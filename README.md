### ðŸŒŸ How It Works

**CodeMusai University** is your personal AI-powered tutor that learns about you as you interact, creating a tailor-made course on any topic you choose. Utilizing advanced AI, it supports third-party integrations, a locally hosted LLM, or our custom **CodeMusaiGPT**.

As you engage with the platform, CodeMusai University evolves with you, refining the course content to match your learning style and interests. Initially, it leverages OpenAI with **cmSoftCoding** to access the internet, but as the platform progresses, **CodeMusaiGPT** will take the lead, allowing for seamless integration with any compliant local LLM.

### ðŸ§  The Learning Process:

1. **Personalized Query Input:** You ask a question or make a request on your chosen topic.
2. **Adaptive Web Scraping:** CodeMusai University searches Google for the most relevant, up-to-date information.
3. **Contextual Content Parsing:** Extracts the most pertinent information from the retrieved content.
4. **Dynamic Prompt Generation:** Combines your query with the parsed content to generate a personalized lesson or answer.
5. **AI-Driven Response:** Calls the OpenAI API to generate a customized response or lesson.
6. **Interactive Learning Experience:** Streams the answer directly to you, continuously adapting the course as you go.
