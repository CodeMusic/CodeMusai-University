### How It Works

CodeMusai University is designed to learn about you as you interact, tailoring a personalized course on any topic of your choosing. Utilizing advanced AI, it supports third-party integrations, a locally hosted LLM, or our custom **CodeMusaiGPT**.

Initially, CodeMusai University leverages OpenAI with **cmSoftCoding** as a gateway to the internet. As the platform evolves, CodeMusaiGPT will take the lead, enabling seamless integration with any compliant local LLM.

### ðŸ§  The Process:

1. **Query Input:** You ask a question or make a request.
2. **Web Scraping:** CodeMusai University scours Google for relevant information.
3. **Content Parsing:** Extracts text from the most relevant pages.
4. **Prompt Generation:** Combines your query with the extracted text.
5. **AI Response:** Calls the OpenAI API to generate a response.
6. **User Interaction:** Streams the answer directly to you.
